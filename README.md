# Loki BT Service - Bluetooth for the Android emulator

Loki BT allows Android developers to use Bluetooth in the Android emulator that ships with Android Studio by emulating Bluetooth over TCP/IP. Loki consists of a web-service and an Android library. This is the repo of the web-service, which is licensed as open-source under the AGPL version 3.

*Loki BT is still an alpha! Its core functionality is working, but there are still some parts of Android's Bluetooth API missing. Apart from that there could still be undiscovered bugs and breaking interface changes are likely to happen, so it is not recommended to use it in production projects, yet.*
